# Systems Analysis

### Laura Valentina Cubillos Acero


This repository contains all the workshops in the course

### Overview
For example on the workshop 1 , we explore the generation of artificial genetic sequences, search for the most frequent motifs, and apply Shannon entropy to filter out repetitive sequences. The project implements a "divide and conquer" approach to efficiently handle the tasks.

### Contents
- Full documentation of Workshop #1.
- Source code for generating sequences, searching for motifs, and entropy filtering.
- Output files including generated sequences and filtered results.

### Access and Use
This repository is publicly available for anyone to view and access. Feel free to explore the files and run the code for your own testing or analysis.
